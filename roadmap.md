# Roadmap — BOOM/Rocket/CVA6 to Anvil Conversion

## Project Goal
Convert three RISC-V processor implementations (BOOM, Rocket Chip, CVA6) from their source HDL to Anvil, then verify equivalence by compiling Anvil back to SystemVerilog.

## Course Corrections

### 2026-04-17 (early): All 27 .anvil files failed to compile
Root causes: regex-based converter, no compiler validation, wrong Anvil semantics. Led to M3.

### 2026-04-17 (late): M3 complete, converter improved to 8/43 pass rate
AST-based converter rewrite (Maya), hand-written references (Dana, Leo), mapping guide (Finn).
Remaining 35 failures: 17 undefined-identifier (cross-scope let bindings), 6 syntax errors (! and $ chars), 3 type mismatches.

### 2026-04-18: M4 complete — 43/43 CVA6 core compile
Ares's team achieved full compilation of all 43 CVA6 core modules. Independently verified by Athena. Converter at 2243 lines (AST-based). However, converter only passes ~33% of non-core CVA6 files — additional patterns needed.

## Milestones

### M1: Research & Foundation (budget: 4 impl cycles)
**Status:** COMPLETE

### M1.1–M2.2: Previous conversion batches
**Status:** INVALIDATED — superseded by M3/M4

### M3: Anvil Compiler Validation & Reference Conversion (budget: 8 cycles)
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

### M4: Fix Converter & Achieve 43/43 CVA6 Core Compilation (budget: 8 cycles)
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓ (verified 2026-04-18)
**Results:** All 43 CVA6 core .anvil files in converted/ pass `anvil -just-check`

### M5: CVA6 Utility & SoC Integration Modules (budget: 8 cycles)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Scope:** Convert 39 non-core, non-testbench, non-vendor CVA6 files:
- common/local/util/ (9 files): SRAMs, find_first_one, instr_tracer, tc_sram_wrappers
- corev_apu/ non-tb (30 files): SoC integration (ariane, clint, bootrom, FPGA wrappers, instruction tracing, openpiton)
**Excludes:** vendor/ (153 files, third-party PULP IP), pd/ (3 files, synthesis wrappers), tb/ (36 files, testbenches), verif/ (~80 files, UVM verification)
**Approach:** Improve converter to handle new patterns (interfaces, packages, generate blocks), then hand-fix remaining failures
**Acceptance criteria:** All 39 .anvil files pass `anvil -just-check` with exit code 0

### M6: CVA6 Vendor & Remaining Files (budget: TBD)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Convert vendor/pulp-platform (153 files) and remaining CVA6 files

### M7: BOOM Conversion (budget: TBD)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Convert BOOM to Anvil. Chisel-based, needs Chisel→SV→Anvil pipeline.

### M8: Rocket Chip Conversion (budget: TBD)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Convert Rocket Chip to Anvil. Chisel-based, largest codebase.

### M9: Validation & Polish (budget: TBD)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Full round-trip verification. Compile Anvil→SV, compare with originals.

## Lessons Learned
- **CRITICAL: Always compile-check output.** The team produced 27 files over many cycles without ever running the compiler. ALL were invalid. Verification MUST include `anvil -just-check` on every file.
- **Understand the target language deeply before converting.** Anvil is fundamentally different from SV — it uses channels, send/recv, lifetimes, not ports. A superficial syntax mapping is insufficient.
- **Regex-based conversion is insufficient.** Human feedback confirmed: need a proper parser that understands SV AST and maps it to Anvil semantics, not just syntax.
- **Previous lessons still apply:** 1 module per worker, parallel conversion + sequential verification, scale workers for throughput.
- **Planning budget:** Target 1 cycle for milestone planning.
- **Manual conversion >> auto conversion:** Need reference manual conversions before automating.
- **Cross-scope variable references are the #1 converter issue.** SV `always_comb` assigns variables used in `always_ff`. Anvil `let` bindings are scoped — converter must promote these to `reg` or restructure scopes.
- **Anvil negation is `~`, not `!`.** The converter must translate SV `!` to Anvil `~` for logical negation.
- **Converter generalization needed.** 43/43 core pass rate doesn't transfer — non-core files have interfaces, packages, generate blocks that the converter doesn't handle yet (~33% pass rate on non-core).

## Progress Tracking
- CVA6 core: 43/43 compile ✓
- CVA6 utility+SoC: 0/39 (M5 in progress)
- CVA6 vendor: 0/153
- CVA6 testbench/verif: 0/~116 (low priority)
- BOOM: not started
- Rocket Chip: not started

## Research Findings
- CVA6 = native SV (42K LOC), best first target (moderate complexity, clean modules)
- BOOM = Chisel (38K LOC), needs Chisel→Verilog→Anvil pipeline
- Rocket Chip = Chisel (55K LOC), largest/most complex, SoC generator
- Anvil: process-oriented HDL, channels with lifetimes, implicit clk/rst
- Anvil toolchain available at `/opt/opam/default/bin/anvil`
- Anvil key concepts: proc (not module), chan (channels with left/right endpoints), send/recv, reg + set, let bindings, loop, generate/generate_seq, >> (sequence), ; (parallel join)
